### Bugs ###
* Emits empty styles*.js after `npm run build`, this might be fixed with Webpack 5, for now - just delete or leave those files alone, it useless.

### Using / Changing ###
* made desired changes to package.json, webpack.config.js and/or other files
* open b4st/assets directory with terminal, type `npm i`, then `npm run build` for production or `npm run dev` for developing
* wait until new files will be generated by Webpack
